# Create a Modern Blog App with React, GraphQL, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and GraphCMS (Hygraph)

This fully responsive #HeadlessCMS Blog App allows you or your clients to manage the blog using a dedicated Content Management System. It includes featured and recent posts, categories, full markdown articles, author information, comments, and more. The app is built using the latest technologies such as React JS, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, GraphQL, and GraphCMS.

You can check out the blog at https://www.pohha.blog/. I am currently working on it and adding new features.
